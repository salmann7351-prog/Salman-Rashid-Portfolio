# Salman Rashid - Personal Research Website

A static, editorial-style academic website. Plain HTML, CSS, and a small
amount of vanilla JavaScript (mobile navigation only). No build step, no
framework, no paid services.

All paths are relative, so the site works unmodified from any subpath or
custom domain.

## Editing content

There is no CMS or templating - each page is plain HTML. To edit text,
open the relevant `.html` file and edit directly. Shared structure (header
navigation, footer) is repeated at the top and bottom of every file; if you
change the navigation, update it consistently across all pages, or ask
an AI assistant to do a find-and-replace across the folder.

Common edits:
- **Change a research project's status** (e.g. once Project 2's brief is
  published): edit the `<span class="status-badge">` line and the "Current
  status" section near the bottom of the relevant `research-*.html` file.
- **Add a research interest note**: edit the relevant `<div class="interest-row">`
  block in `index.html` and `research.html`.
- **Add a notes entry**: add a new `<div class="timeline-item">` block in
- **Add a footer link** (e.g. Google Scholar, ORCID): edit the `FOOTER`
  block if you regenerate via `build.py`, or edit the `<footer>` markup
  directly in each HTML file.

## Deploying to GitHub + Vercel

1. **Create a GitHub repository** and push this folder as its contents:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial site"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Vercel:**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with GitHub.
   - Click "Add New… → Project" and import the repository.
   - Framework preset: choose **"Other"** (no build step is needed).
   - Leave the build command and output directory blank - Vercel will
     serve the static files as-is.
   - Click Deploy.

3. **Custom domain (optional):** in the Vercel project settings, go to
   "Domains" and add your domain, then follow Vercel's DNS instructions.

No environment variables, API keys, or backend services are required.

## Notes on content accuracy

All research content on this site (statuses, figures, author lists,
affiliations) reflects the source documents provided at the time of
build. Two items are intentionally left as placeholders pending further
material:

- **Research interests 3 and 4** (Geoeconomics & Political Economy;
  Maritime Economics & Conflict) are listed with a "notes to follow" tag
  and no claimed outputs.
- **Project 2's final format** (policy brief vs. working paper) is
  pending a decision; update the status badge on
  `research-diagnosing-inflation.html` once confirmed.

When Project 2 is published, add its live URL as a link in that page's
"Current status" section.
